# Nebula
<img src="./img/logo.png" alt="logo" width="200" align="center"/>

Nebula is a Cloud and (hopefully) DevOps Penetration Testing framework. 
It is build with modules for each provider and each functionality. As of April 2021, it only covers AWS, but is currently an ongoing project and hopefully will continue to grow to test GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, or automation engines like Ansible, Terraform, Chef, etc.
I started writting it while I was reading "Hands-On AWS Penetration Testing with Kali Linux" (https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Penetration-Testing-Kali-Linux/dp/1789136725) and was based on Pacu (https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/pacu)

**Presentations:**
- BlackHat Europe 2021: https://www.blackhat.com/eu-21/arsenal/schedule/index.html#nebula-a-case-study-in-penetrating-something-as-soft-as-a-cloud-25174

**Currently covers:**
- S3 Bucket name bruteforce
- IAM, EC2, S3, STS and Lambda Enumeration
- IAM, EC2, STS, and S3 exploitation
- SSM Enumeration + Exploitation
- Custom HTTP User-Agent
- Enumerate Read Privileges (working on write privs)
- Reverse Shell
- No creds Reconnaisance

**There are currently 67 modules covering:**
- Reconnaissance
- Enumeration
- Exploit
- Cleanup
- Reverse Shell

**Version 3.0 Includes:**
- Team cooperation with the client-teamserver architecture 
- All the requests requires authentication (except for the authentication request ofc)
- All the information is stored into a MongoDB Server and accessible using commands. The information will ofc have to been enumerated before, but this allows you to not reenumerate a certain object 
    - list_aws_iam_users => will list all AWS IAM users and the enumerated info from the database
    - get_aws_iam_user <user> => will get info from the database on only one user enumerated

## Installation

### Docker
#### From Dockerhub
Clone the Nebula Repo from Github and pull Nebula Docker image:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/gl4ssesbo1/Nebula
docker pull gl4ssesbo1/nebula:latest
```
and then run teamserver.py through:

```
cd Nebula
docker run -d -v $(pwd):/app -ti gl4ssesbo1/nebula:latest teamserver.py -dn <workspace name> -p <cosmonaut password>
```
The workspace will also be the MongoDB Database's name, so I suggest you stick with the same one over the whole assessment.
If you want, you can also add the teamserver API host (default 127.0.0.1), port(default 5000) and MOngoDB instance host(default 127.0.0.1) and port(default 27017).

Remember to not also forget -v option, because it allows files to be saved on the system even after removing the docker image.

Then run the client using:
```
cd Nebula
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -p 27017:27017 -ti gl4ssesbo1/nebula:latest client/client.py -w <workspace name> --password <cosmonaut password> 
```

or give a username with -u option:

```
cd Nebula
docker run -v $(pwd):/app -p 5000:5000 -p 27017:27017 -ti gl4ssesbo1/nebula:latest client/client.py -w <workspace name> -u <username> --password <password> 
```

#### Using DockerFile
Clone the Nebula Repo from Github and build Docker image locally:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/gl4ssesbo1/Nebula
docker build -t nebula .
```
then run everything as above.

### Installed on System
Nebula is coded in python3.8 and tested on python3.8 and 3.9. It uses boto3 library to access AWS. To install, just install python 3.8+ and install libraries required from *requirements.txt*

```
python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Then install session-manager-plugin. This is needed for SSM modules:
```
curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/ubuntu_64bit/session-manager-plugin.deb" -o "session-manager-plugin.deb"
dpkg -i session-manager-plugin.deb
```
On windows devices, since less is not installed, I got one from **https://github.com/jftuga/less-Windows**
The prebuilt binary is saved on directory less_binary. Just add that directory to the PATH environment variable and it will be ok.

Then just run **teamserver** 
```
teamserver -dn <workspace name> -p <password>
```
and **client**
```
client/nebula -w <workspace name> -u <username> --password <password> 
```

### Enum Privs
When you have a set of credentials, you can enter *getuid* to get the user or *enum_user_privs* to check the Read permission of a set of credentials.
#### GetUID
```
(test)()(AWS) >>> getuid
------------------------------------------------
UserId: A******************Q
------------------------------------------------
        UserID: A******************Q
        Arn: arn:aws:iam::012345678912:user/user_user

[*] Output is saved to './workspaces/test/12_07_2021_02_22_54_getuid_dev_brian'
```

If the creds do not have the below privs on himself,
```
STS:GetUserIdentity
IAM:GetUser
IAM:ListAttachedUserPolicies
IAM:GetPolicy (for all policies)
```
you will get an error:
```
[*] An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetUser operation: User: arn:aws:iam::012345678912:user/user_user is not authorized to perform: iam:GetUser on resource: user user_user
```
#### Enum_User_Privs
This command checks List and Describe Privileges on a set of credentials.
```
(test)()(AWS) >>> enum_user_privs
User: user_user
        UserID: A******************Q
        Arn: arn:aws:iam::012345678912:user/user_user

#### Running the module
To run the module, if it requires credentials, you will need to have imported a set of credentials with the permission required to run it. This is shown on a module's options as:
```
Needs Credentials: True
-----------------------------
```
To run it, just enter **run**. Depending on the output, it will either show a pagainated view, or just print it. The pagination, uses less binary, which for Windows uses the binary from **https://github.com/jftuga/less-Windows**. A copy of the exe is on less_binary directory.
The output is also saved on files on the workspace directory:
```
(work1)()(enum/aws_ec2_enum_instances) >>> run
[*] Content dumped on file './workspaces/work1/16_04_2021_18_16_48_ec2_enum_instances'.
```

### Credentials
####Inputing Credentials
Nebula can use both AccessKeyID + SecretKey combination and AccessKeyID + SecretKey+SessionKey combination to authenticate into the infratructure.
To insert a set of credentials, use:
```
()()(AWS) >>> set credentials test1
Profile Name: test1
Access Key ID: A*********2
Secret Key ID: a****************************7
Region: us-west-3

Do you also have a session token?[y/N]
[*] Credentials set. Use 'show credentials' to check them.
[*] Currect credential profile set to 'test1'.Use 'show current-creds' to check them.
```
And you will get some inputs allowing you to set them. Session token can be added when entering credentials, by inputing **y** when asked **Do you also have a session token?[y/N]**.

####Using Credentials
To use another credential, just enter:
```
()()(AWS) >>> use credentials test1
[*] Currect credential profile set to 'test1'.Use 'show current-creds' to check them.
```
####Current Credentials
When you enter the credentials, they are automatically made the current credentials, meaning the ones you will authenticate with. To check the current credentials, use:
```
()()(AWS) >>> show current-creds
{
    "profile": "test1",
    "access_key_id": "A*********2",
    "secret_key": "a****************************7",
    "region": "us-west-3"
}
```
####Removing Credentials
In case you don't want your credentials, you can can remove them using:
```
()()(AWS) >>> remove credentials test1
You are about to remove credential 'test1'. Are you sure? [y/N] y
```
####Dumping and importing credentials
In case you want your credentials saved on the machine, you can use:
```
()()(AWS) >>> dump credentials
[*] Credentials dumped on file './credentials/16_04_2021_17_37_59'.
```
And they will be saved on a file containing the time and date of the dump on directory *credentials* on Nebula directory.
To import them, just enter:
```
()()(AWS) >>> import credentials 16_04_2021_17_37_59
()()(AWS) >>> show credentials
[
    {
        "profile": "test1",
        "access_key_id": "A*********2",
        "secret_key": "a****************************7",
        "region": "us-west-3"
    }
]
```
### Workspaces
Nebula uses workspaces to save the output from every command. The output is saved as json data (except for s3_name_fuzzer which saves it as XML) on a folder created on directory *workspaces*.
#### Create Workspaces
To create one, enter:
```
()()(AWS) >>> create workspace work1
[*] Workspace 'work1' created.
[*] Current workspace set at 'work1'.
(work1)()(AWS) >>> ls ./workspaces


    Directory: C:\Users\***\Desktop\Nebula\workspaces


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----         4/16/2021   5:42 PM                work1
-a----         4/16/2021   4:40 PM              0 __init__.py
```
When created, the first brackets will contain the name of the workspace you are working at.
If you want to use an existing workspace, just type:
```
()()(AWS) >>> use workspace work1
(work1)()(AWS) >>>
```
Workspaces are required to be used, so even if you are not using any at the moment, while running a module, it will ask you to create one with random name or to just create one with a custom name yourself.
```
()()(enum/aws_ec2_enum_instances) >>> run
A workspace is not configured. Workstation 'qxryiuct' will be created. Are you sure? [y/N] n
[*] Create a workstation first using 'create workstation <workstation name>'.
()()(enum/aws_ec2_enum_instances) >>>
```
#### List workspaces
To get a list of workspaces, use:
```
(work1)()(enum/aws_ec2_enum_instances) >>> show workspaces
-----------------------------------
Workspaces:
-----------------------------------
        work1

(work1)()(enum/aws_ec2_enum_instances) >>>
```
#### Remove Workspaces
To remove a workspace, enter:
```
()()(AWS) >>> remove workspace work1
[*] Are you sure you want to delete the workspace? [y/N] y
()()(AWS) >>> show workspaces
-----------------------------------
Workspaces:
-----------------------------------

()()(AWS) >>>
```
### Reverse Shell
To create a Reverse Shell, you need to create a stager and run a listener. To use this feature, you need to have Nebula run as root (to open ports).
#### Stager
To generate a stager, use modules on *stagers*:
```
()()(AWS) >>> use module stager/aws_python_tcp
()()(stager/aws_python_tcp) >>> options
Desctiption:
-----------------------------
        The TCP Reverse Shell that is used by listeners/aws_python_tcp_listener

        None

Options:
-----------------------------
        SERVICE:        none
                Required: true
                Description: The service that will be used to run the module. It cannot be changed.

        HOST:
                Required: true
                Description: The Host/IP of the C2 Server.

        PORT:
                Required: true
                Description: The C2 Server Port.

        FORMAT:
                Required: true
                Description: The format of the stager. Currently only allows 'py' for Python and 'elf' for ELF Binary.

        CALLBACK-TIME:  None
                Required: true
                Description: The time in seconds between callbacks from Stager. The Stager calls back even if the server crashes or is stoped in a loop.

        OUTPUT-FILE-NAME:
                Required: true
                Description: The name of the stager output file.
```
The options to fill are:
   - **HOST**: The IP or domain of the C2 Server
   - **Port**: The C2 Server Port
   - **Format**: Currently only supports python raw file and elf binary
   - **Callback-Time**: The time in seconds for which the sessions should call back. It calls back even if a current session is up, and even if the server crushes or is closed, so that you don't loose access to the machine.
   - **Output File Name**: The name of the output file.

Running the module will generate a stager saved on **./workspaces/workspacename/stagername**

#### Listener
The listener is simple. Just configure Host (by default set to 0.0.0.0) and Port and it creates the server. To run the listener, you need to have Nebula run as root.
```
